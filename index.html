                            My Name is Andrew McElhannon, and though I'm from the East Coast, I'm currently a third
                            year undergrad at University of San Diego. I'm pursuing a BA in computer science and am
                            set to graduate in 2026.

                        <p>
                            I've taken numerous courses in computer science, with an emphasis on OOP and design
                            principles. In the future, I'd love to learn more about AI (CNNs, Pathfinding algorithms)
                            and Cybersecurity.

                            In my freetime, I enjoy the great outdoors when I can(hiking, walking, parks, exploring
                            new places with friends). I also love speakers and home theater, a hobby with the great
                            benefit of affecting every pastime. Videogames? Music? Movies? I think everyone could do
                            with a good sound system.

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            In a comp class, my friends and I were given the task of creating a final project for the
                            semester. Using the opporunity, we decided to make something that would be extra-helpful to
                            one our group members, who is an avid surfer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using weather data pulled from government buoys and weather stations and a short
                            questionnaire/evaluation algorithm of our own design, we created a system that allows a
                            user to view real-time surfdata and get surf spot recommendations, right from the
                            comfort of the computer terminal.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <h3>Project Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            On setup, SurfBuddy object is initialized and populated with surfSpots- a class
                            representing individual surfing locations. It contains info such as a short description,
                            geographical position, and the nearest NOAA buoy. The geographical position and buoy
                            name are used to request data object from a specialized Request class, which is
                            connected to both the NOAA and NDBC APIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, using the terminal, a user fills out a short questionnaire, populating an
                            EnvPreferences object. This is used by the Evaluator class, which uses user's responses
                            and a homemade algorithm to rate a SurfSpot's desirability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The user is able to choose from the following options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The ability to list all given surfSpots. For the purpose of this project, SoCal surfing
                                locations were chosen as sample data.
                            </li>

                            <li>The ability to look at each surfSpot individually</li>

                            <li>The ability to look at a list of surfSpots ranked by desirability</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was personally responsible for much of the overview design (separating classes,
                            choosing methods) and for implementing the SurfSpot and SurfBuddy class.

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            While studying abroad in Rome, I was enrolled in HTML and CSS class. The final project was
                            to personally design, code, and build a fully interactive web page. I ended up making
                            an online clothing store for a made-up company I named Generallt.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <h3>Project Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            The whole project itself took about three weeks, during which I spent about 30 hours going
                            from notepad sketches to a built website. I used VSCode and some helpful extensions to
                            build it, and the majority of my time was spent organizing and styling. I found it was
                            one thing to recreate an example webpage in class, and quite another to design everything
                            yourself. Having each web page be navigable, clear, and coherent with each other is hard! I
                            ended up redesigning the entire projet several times, but I'm proud of the end result. I
                            think it's a solid project filled with little easter eggs and effort, but in the future if I
                            have more time I may update it with pop-up banners and a more convincing checkout.
